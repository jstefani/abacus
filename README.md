this norns script creates sequences of samples from a tape. you can load any tape and splice it into up to 26 samples (named a-z). samples can then be patterned into 16-subdivided measures. patterns can then be chained together.

this script follow a lot of previous things. i got inspiration/code from [glitchlets](https://github.com/schollz/glitchlets) and [beets](https://llllllll.co/t/beets-1-0/30069) and designed a lot of aspects similar to how the po-33 sampler works, but more tuned to my tastes.

future directions:

- fix all the üêõüêõüêõ
- add sample specific filters

## my other norns

- [barcode](https://github.com/schollz/barcode): replays a buffer six times, at different levels & pans & rates & positions, modulated by lfos on every parameter.
- [blndr](https://github.com/schollz/blndr): a quantized delay with time morphing
- [clcks](https://github.com/schollz/clcks): a tempo-locked repeater
- [oooooo](https://github.com/schollz/oooooo): digital tape loops
- [piwip](https://github.com/schollz/piwip): play instruments while instruments play.
- [glitchlets](https://github.com/schollz/glitchlets): 
add glitching to everything.
